<!-- There is also a HTML quiz that is 40 questions. This is the link "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp" -->

 <!-- HTML teaches you how to make websites. (Hyper Text Markup Language)
  It uses markup to describe the structure of web pages. 
  The structure is built up by elements, and they are represented by tags.
  Tags label pieces of content such as heading (<h1> </h1>), paragraph <p> </p>, table (<table> </table>, etc.)
  TIME TO TRY TOGETHER 
  We start by declaring that this is an html document (<html> </html>) <- this is the root element of any html page
  The <head> </head> element contains meta information about the document
  The <title> </title> element specifies a title for the document
  The <body> </body> element contains the visible page content
  Finally, the <h1> </h1> element defines a large heading, while the <p> </p> element defines a paragraph    -->

  <!DOCTYPE html> <!--  <- I just added this idk if you need this or not (try deleting and see if everything still works. I think this is just standard to always have) -->
  <html>
  <head>
  <title> Page Title </title>
  </head>
  <body>

  <h1> My First Heading </h1>
  <p> My First Paragraph </p>
  
  </body>
  </html>
