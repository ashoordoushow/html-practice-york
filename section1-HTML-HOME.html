 <!-- HTML teaches you how to make websites. (Hyper Text Markup Language)
  It uses markup to describe the structure of web pages. 
  The structure is built up by elements, and they are represented by tags.
  Tags label pieces of content such as heading (<h1> </h1>), paragraph <p> </p>, table (<table> </table>, etc.)
  TIME TO TRY TOGETHER 
  We start by declaring that this is an html document (<html> </html>) <- this is the root element of any html page
  The <head> </head> element contains meta information about the document
  The <title> </title> element specifies a title for the document
  The <body> </body> element contains the visible page content
  Finally, the <h1> </h1> element defines a large heading, while the <p> </p> element defines a paragraph   
  tags typically come in pairs; a start tag and the end tag
  Web Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) turn html code/elements into a viewable website
  ^ there purpose is to read html documents and display them
  (skeleton - means the building blocks/code that's behind a webpage)

  <!DOCTYPE html> <!--  <- I just added this idk if you need this or not (try deleting and see if everything still works. I think this is just standard to always have) -->
  <html>
  <head>
  <title> Page Title </title> <!-- this content is not visible, whatever is in the body contains the visible page content -->
  </head>
  <body>

  <h1> My First Heading </h1>
  <p> My First Paragraph </p>
  
  </body>
  </html>

  <tagname> content goes here </tagname>

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title> My First Practice HTML page </title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1> My First Practice HTML page </h1>
      <p> I am learning and understand how to write an HTML document. </p>
